# SortingAlgos

Sorting is a class of algorithms that are tasked with rearranging the positions of elements of an array such that all of its elements are either in ascending or descending order. A good sorting algorithm also needs to ensure that elements having the same value donâ€™t change their locations in the sorted array. Sorting is necessary for getting a concrete understanding of data structures and algorithms.
